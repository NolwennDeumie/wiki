We have all dreamt to create a game with our own pixel art resources. So we open our favorite software, a new document and.. What’s next ? 

Pixel art is a drawing technique that counts on **minimalism**, the simplicity of what is perceived, regardless of a work’s quantity of details.

When we look at a complex scene of a very realistic painting for instance, human brain can’t take into account all the visible information at once: it will interpret it in its own way, recording only what catched its attention first.
That is why well-known painters play with objects’ positioning, colours, light and other devices in order to make sure the spectator will correctly interpret what they see. It is even more important when it is a picture or a scene we will only see a few seconds.

This **composition** concept can be found not only in painting, but also in video games, cinema, photography, architecture or any visual media. 


## Examples of compositions in various fields.

In this classic painting of Eugène Delacroix, *La Liberté guidant le pleuple*, despite the complexity of the scene, the eye immedieately draws up to the Liberty that emerges from the ground with the french flag. If ever you are interested, here is a [relevant case study about this painting](https://www.histoire-image.org/fr/etudes/liberte-guidant-peuple-eugene-delacroix).

This picture from the movie *Moonrise Kingdom* shows the great attention to detail that had the film director which complements the scenario. Notice that each object's positioning has been thought to showcase the symetry of the scene and the neat and obedient aspect of the children, except the little girl. Here is a video on the topic if ever you are interested once again: [« You Know It's Wes Anderson IF... »](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqfRmceGwUs). Otherwise, you can also watch the pretty pictures of [« Wes Anderson // Centered »](https://vimeo.com/89302848)!

Ah, finally something familiar! In this map by [RitoJS](https://twitter.com/RitoJS), each tile has been strategically placed in order to simulate the wanted atmosphere while showing the path to the player. Thus the composition is truly an important aspect of mapping.

Human brain only interpret some information when it sees a picture. This way, in a complex and badly planed scene, *we don't know where to look* and the image becomes barely understandable and harsh to interpret. In a video game context, this notion is even more important as the player doesn't focus on graphics.

The aim is that each of your graphic element has a precise role in the global image composition in order to obtain something consistent. That is why I would advise you to *start small*! Game Boy games are a good inspiration as they maintain a remarkable readability even if they have to display a huge variety of situations with only 4 colours.
