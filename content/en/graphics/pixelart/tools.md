The first thing to identify before doing pixel art is the software we're going to use. There are several ones, and each has its own pros and cons.

## Photoshop

Paid software. This is the one I use because I'm familiar with it, but you probably do not need such a complete software just for pixel art! However, if you already have it, it will perfectly do the job. To configure Photoshop in order to do pixel art, you can watch [« Configurer Photoshop pour dessiner en Pixel Art »](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kysCbzLH87E) by Scendre.

## Krita

Free and open source software. Krita offers various tools for pixel art or tilesets which ease the work, such as dithering brushes, selections without anti-aliasing, etc. To configure Krita for pixel art, you can watch [« Faire du Pixel Art avec Krita »](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8qfmkrgciic) par GD Quest.

## GraphicsGale

Free software, only on Windows. It is a software entirely dedicated to pixel art, which means it has interesting tools, including animation! Thus, it doesn't have the transformation or adjustment advantages that Krita or Photoshop possess, but it is really light and easy to use. If you want to know more, you can watch [« Introduction à GraphicsGale »](http://www.lesforges.org/article/introduction-graphicsgale?scroll_to=article), par Thomas Chassin sur les Forges.

There are obviously other softwares, such as the paid one [Aseprite](https://www.aseprite.org/), the online app [Piskel](https://www.piskelapp.com/), or [GrafX2](http://pulkomandy.tk/projects/GrafX2), a free software specialized in bitmap picture. If you are still hesitating, you can consult the ranking [« What are the best pixel art / sprite editors? »](https://www.slant.co/topics/1547/~pixel-art-sprite-editors) on Slant.
